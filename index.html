  <h3>WRITE A STORY!</h3>
  <p>Hello! I am Ayushi.</p>
  <p>I am a student, a learner, a reader, and a writer! And while writing, I use the pen-name: <em>Vrinda Aryya.</em></p>
  <p>So, today, I am going to showcase one of the stories I had written. It is a 6 sentences story, and I am pretty proud that I could actually write it, provided my speciality lies in writing long pieces of works.</p>
  <p>So, if you like pirates, a dash of fantasy, and a little bit of grimness, head over to the link below! And don't forget to rate the story!</p>
